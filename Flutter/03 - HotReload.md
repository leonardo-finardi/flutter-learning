- Hot Reload is a powerful feature in Flutter that allows developers to make changes to their code and instantly see the updated UI without losing the current app state.
- It speeds up the development process by eliminating the need to manually rebuild and restart the entire app after every code change.

## Enabling Hot Reload

Hot Reload is enabled by default in Flutter development.
To use Hot Reload, simply make the desired code changes in your Flutter project.

## Basic Usage of Hot Reload

Make any code changes you want in your project, such as modifying UI elements, updating business logic, or changing styles.
Save the modified files in your IDE or text editor.
Observe that the Flutter framework automatically detects the changes and applies them to the running app almost instantly.

## Hot Reload in Action

Let's consider a simple example where you have a counter app with a button that increments a counter when pressed.
Initially, the counter is set to 0, and the UI displays the counter value.
You can use Hot Reload to make changes to the UI or the logic of the counter without losing the current counter value or restarting the app.

Example:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: CounterScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class CounterScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CounterScreenState createState() => _CounterScreenState();
}

class _CounterScreenState extends State<CounterScreen> {
  int counter = 0;

  void incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Counter App'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text(
              'Counter: $counter',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
            ),
            SizedBox(height: 20),
            RaisedButton(
              onPressed: incrementCounter,
              child: Text('Increment'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```
